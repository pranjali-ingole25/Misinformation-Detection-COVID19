# Misinformation-Detection-COVID19
A machine learning project to detect misinformation related to COVID-19 using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with 91% accuracy.The goal of this project is to classify news articles or social media posts as either fake or real using machine learning techniques. 

# Key Features
1.Fake vs Real News Detection: Classify news articles into fake and real categories based on their content.

2.Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes NLP techniques to process and clean textual data.

3.Machine Learning Model: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to detect fake news with high accuracy.

4.Evaluation: The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and confusion matrix.

# Features
The project uses the following features for detecting misinformation related to COVID-19:

Text Data Preprocessing: Removal of punctuation, special characters, and stopwords.Text lowercasing and tokenization.Lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.

Feature Extraction:  TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text into numerical features by measuring the importance of words in the dataset.

Machine Learning Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel.

# Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The model achieved 91% accuracy.
Confusion Matrix: Displays the count of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Detailed performance metrics to assess how well the model is detecting fake vs. real news.

# Evaluation Metrics
The model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: 91%
Precision (Real News): 0.89
Recall (Real News): 0.94
Precision (Fake News): 0.93
Recall (Fake News): 0.88
F1-Score: 0.91
