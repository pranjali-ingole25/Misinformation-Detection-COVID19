# Misinformation-Detection-COVID19
A machine learning project to detect misinformation related to COVID-19 using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with 91% accuracy.The goal of this project is to classify news articles or social media posts as either fake or real using machine learning techniques. 

## **Key Features**

1. **Fake vs Real News Detection:** Classifies news articles into **fake and real categories** based on their content.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilizes NLP techniques to **process and clean textual data**.
3. **Machine Learning Model:** Employs a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to detect fake news with high accuracy.
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** The model is evaluated using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and confusion matrix**.
   
## **Evaluation**

The model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

* **Accuracy:** Achieved **91% accuracy** on the test dataset.
* **Confusion Matrix:** Displays the count of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
* **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:** Detailed metrics to assess the modelâ€™s performance in detecting fake vs. real news.

### **Evaluation Metrics**

| Metric        | Real News (1) | Fake News (0) | Overall |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| **Precision** | 0.89          | 0.93          | -       |
| **Recall**    | 0.94          | 0.88          | -       |
| **F1-Score**  | 0.92          | 0.90          | 0.91    |
| **Accuracy**  | -             | -             | 91%     |
